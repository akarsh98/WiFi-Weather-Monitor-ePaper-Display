The Display is connected to an esp8266, you can use an esp32 as well with this display. The esp8266 is connected to the internet using wifi whose details can be changed through the code which I have provided on github. So lets get started!

I have also made a video about building this project in detail, I recommend watching that for better insight and detail.
